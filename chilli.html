                There is profuse shedding of flowers. The flower stalk shrivel and dry up. This drying up spreads from the flower stalks to the stem and subsequently causes die-back of the branches and stem and the branches wither. Partia1lly affected plants bear fruits which are few and of low quality

            <p align="center"><u>Mosaic complex. Symptom:<br></u>
                Young leaves develop a yellowish mosaic followed by diffused chlorosis and become distorted, elongated and stunted. Large yellowish ring spots and oak leaf markings develop on older leaves. Affected leaves frequently drop prematurely. On fruits, concentric rings and solid circular spots develop.
