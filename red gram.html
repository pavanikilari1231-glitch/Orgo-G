        <h2>About...</h2>
        
        <p>Red gram, commonly known as pigeon pea or toor dal, is a perennial legume that's grown as an annual crop. It's an important pulse crop cultivated for its edible seeds. The plant is a small shrub with trifoliate leaves and yellow, red, or pink flowers. The seeds, which come in various shades of red, brown, or yellow, are rich in protein and used in cooking across many cultures. Red gram is known for its ability to tolerate dry and semi-arid conditions, making it a crucial crop in regions with erratic rainfall patterns. It's also beneficial in crop rotation due to its nitrogen-fixing properties, enhancing soil fertility.</p>
