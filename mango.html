        <h2>About...</h2>
        
        <p>Mango (Mangifera indica) is often hailed as the "king of fruits" due to its delicious taste, aroma, and nutritional value. Here's a general description of the mango fruit crop:<br>
            <u>Tree Description:</u><br>
            * Mango trees are evergreen and can grow quite large, reaching heights of 65 to 100 feet.<br>
            * They have dense foliage with shiny, dark green leaves that are often lance-shaped.<br>
            * The tree bears small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that develop into fruit.<br>
            <u>Fruit Description:</u><br>
            * Mango fruits vary in size, shape, and color depending on the variety. They can be oval, round, kidney-shaped, or even elongated.<br>
            * The skin color ranges from green to yellow, red, or orange when ripe, and it might have a combination of these colors.<br>
            * The pulp inside is juicy, sweet, and has a rich, distinct flavor with varying degrees of tartness depending on the variety.<br>
            * The seed or pit inside is large and flat, usually adhering tightly to the flesh.<br>

            <p align="center"><u>Anthracnose symptoms:<br></u>
                This is a fungal disease caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. It leads to dark lesions on leaves, flowers, and fruits, causing premature fruit drop and reduced yield.  
                <br><u>Anthracnose solution:<br></u>
            <span style='font-size:15px;'>&#11166;</span> <u>Compost:</u>><br>
            * Collect Organic Materials: Gather organic waste such as kitchen scraps (fruit peels, vegetable remains), yard waste (grass clippings, leaves), and manure (if available).<br>
            * Layering: Alternate layers of green materials (like kitchen scraps) and brown materials (like dry leaves or straw) in a compost bin or pile. Add a thin layer of manure if you have it.<br>
            * Moisture and Aeration: Ensure the compost pile stays moist but not waterlogged. Turn the pile occasionally to aerate it, which helps the decomposition process.<br>
            * Time: Composting takes time. Depending on the conditions and materials used, it can take several months to a year for the compost to mature.<br>
            * Use: Once the compost turns dark, crumbly, and earthy-smelling, it's ready to use. Spread it around the base of mango trees as a nutrient-rich fertilizer.<br>

            <p align="center"><u>Powdery Mildew Symptoms:<br></u>
                A fungal infection caused by Oidium mangiferae, resulting in white powdery patches on leaves, affecting photosynthesis and causing leaf drop.

                <span style='font-size:15px;'>&#11166;</span> <u>Manure Tea:</u><br>
                * Prepare Manure: Use well-aged manure (cow, chicken, goat) for this purpose. Place a shovel or two of manure in a burlap sack or a porous cloth bag.<br>
                * Soaking: Immerse the sack or bag of manure in a large container of water (a barrel or bucket). Let it soak for several days, stirring occasionally.<br>
                * Dilution: Dilute the resulting tea by mixing it with water. The ratio can vary, but typically a 1:5 or 1:10 ratio of manure tea to water is suitable.<br>
                * Application: Use the diluted manure tea to water the mango trees. Apply around the root zone, avoiding direct contact with the tree trunk.<br>

                * Collect Mulch Material: Gather organic materials like straw, wood chips, or leaves.<br>
                * Spread: Place a layer of mulch around the base of the mango tree. Ensure the mulch is a few inches thick but not touching the tree trunk.<br>
                * Replenish: Periodically replenish the mulch as it decomposes to maintain a consistent layer.<br>

                It is a fungal disease caused by Lasiodiplodia theobromae or other pathogens, resulting in the wilting and dying of branches, often leading to severe damage if left uncontrolled.
                <br><u>Dieback Solution:<br></u>
                <span style='font-size:15px;'>&#11166;</span> Materials Needed:<br>
                * Fish waste (fish heads, bones, guts, or whole fish)<br>
                * Water<br>
                * Container or bucket with a lid<br>
                * A stirring stick or tool<br>
                * Cheesecloth or fine mesh strainer<br>
                * A larger container or bottle for storage<br>
                Steps:<br>
                * Gather Fish Waste: Collect fish waste, such as fish heads, bones, guts, or whole fish that you can obtain from a fish market or leftover after cleaning fish.<br>
                * Chop or Crush the Fish: If using whole fish or larger parts, chop them into smaller pieces or crush them to facilitate decomposition. Smaller pieces will break down more easily.<br>
                * Place in a Container: Put the fish waste into a container or bucket. Ensure it has a lid to prevent strong odors and to keep pests away.<br>
                * Add Water: Cover the fish waste completely with water. Use a ratio of around 1 part fish waste to 2 or 3 parts water. Ensure the fish is submerged.<br>
                * Stir and Mix: Stir the mixture thoroughly to combine the fish waste with the water. This helps in the decomposition process and extraction of nutrients.<br>
                * Cover and Let it Ferment: Close the container with a lid and place it in a warm, sunny spot. Allow the mixture to ferment for around 1 to 2 weeks. Stir it occasionally during this time.<br>
                * Strain the Liquid: After fermentation, strain the mixture through a cheesecloth or fine mesh strainer into another container. Squeeze out as much liquid as possible from the fish remains.<br>
                * Storage: Store the strained liquid (the fish emulsion) in a larger container or bottle with a tight lid. It can be stored in a cool, dark place.<br>
                * Dilution: Before using, dilute the fish emulsion with water. Typically, a ratio of 1 part fish emulsion to 4 or 5 parts water is suitable for application.<br>
                * Application: Use the diluted fish emulsion to water the mango trees around the root zone. Avoid direct contact with the tree trunk.<br>
